// PS5 port frontend (vk-285-134, AI-assisted): the PS2 BIOS, before a game starts.
//
// Build 130's logs: 961 starts on 235 consoles (one console in eight) failed for want of a BIOS, some consoles trying the
// same game dozens of times in a row. What their BIOS folders held instead: nothing (700 of those starts), folders of
// folders, PS1 BIOS files (512 KB), only a BIOS's ROM1/NVM parts, a .zip, a game image, a 0-byte file. PCSX2 looks for the
// BIOS by itself (BiosTools.cpp; on the PS5 also in the BIOS folder's folders, /data/PCSX2 and the drives); these helpers
// take a BIOS out of an archive into the BIOS folder, and say in a sentence what was found instead, for the shelf.
